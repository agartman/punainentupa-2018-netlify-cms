# Testimonials

I had the pleasure of working directly with Atte on one of Assure's products. My experience was that Atte had a great deal of knowledge in all .NET-things, web site/services development; he approached everything with expertness and thoughtfulness. As a teammate Atte was a real pleasure to work with.

I would recommend Atte to anyone looking to add strength to their R&D team, while expecting an easy-going, international-type of attitude as much as professionalism.
